(https://studio3t.com/knowledge-base/articles/mongodb-aggregation-framework/)

- Group based on different gender types

```
db.firstTest.aggregate([
    {
        $group: {
            _id: "$gender"
        }
    }
])
```

```
db.firstTest.aggregate([
    {
        $group: {
            _id: "$address.country"
        }
    }
])
```

```
db.firstTest.aggregate([
    {
        $group: { _id: "$course" }
    }
])
```

```
db.firstTest.aggregate([
    {
        $group: { _id: "$age" }
    }
])
```

- Group different ages and sum up how many people of each group

```
db.firstTest.aggregate([
    {
        $group: {
            _id: "$age",
            count: { $sum: 1 }
        }
    }
])
```

- **Group and Sum Up:**

```
db.firstTest.aggregate([
    {
        $group: {
            _id: "$gender",
            count: { $sum: 1 }
        }
    }
])
```

```
db.firstTest.aggregate([
    {
        $group: {
            _id: "$address.country",
            count: { $sum: 1 }
        }
    }
])
```

- it will group people of different country and also returns an array of objects containing names of of those people

```
db.firstTest.aggregate([
    {
        $group: {
            _id: "$address.country",
            personName: {
                $push: "$name"
            }
        }
    }
])
```

- it will group people of different country and sum up how many people belongs to a specific country and also returns an array of objects containing names of of those people

```
db.firstTest.aggregate([
    {
        $group:
        {
            _id: "$address.country",
            count: { $sum: 1 },
            personName: {
                $push: "$name"
            }
        }
    }
])
```

- it will group people of different country and sum up how many people belongs to a specific country and also returns an array of objects containing whole details of of those people

```
db.firstTest.aggregate([
    {
        $group: {
            _id: "$address.country",
            count: { $sum: 1 },
            detailsInfo: {
                $push: "$$ROOT"
            }
        }
    }
])
```

- it will group people of different country and sum up how many people belongs to a specific country and also returns an array of objects containing specific details of of those people

```
db.firstTest.aggregate([
    {
        // stage-1
        $group: {
            _id: "$address.country",
            count: { $sum: 1 },
            fullDoc: {
                $push: "$$ROOT"
            }
        }
    },
    // stage-2
    {
        $project: {
            "fullDoc.name": 1,
            "fullDoc.email": 1,
            "fullDoc.phone": 1
        }
    }
